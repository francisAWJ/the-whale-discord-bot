# The Whale - a Discord bot with random functions

I made this bot a while ago so that me and my friends on Discord could have a bot for listening to music. Over time I added some random functionality to the bot.

This thing used to be hosted on Google Cloud Platform, but due to the complexity of dealing with GCP it became a chore to maintain, and now it sits dormant in my friends and I's Discord server. The usual services for hosting a Discord bot were unfortunately not available to me.

Here are some of the things that the bot can do:
- Play music from YouTube, complete with pause, play, stop, and resume functionality
- Create Steven Seagal memes through PIL (I don't know why I added this.)
- Basic functionality for playing tabletop RPGs, such as a d20 dice roller and a command that allows searching through Archives of Nethys

The bot was made using [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). The bot needs ffmpeg.exe to run.
